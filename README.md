🤝 Skill Swap – Peer-to-Peer Learning & Collaboration Platform
Skill Swap is an interactive web-based platform that empowers students to share, learn, and collaborate by exchanging skills. Designed especially for college communities, it connects individuals based on what they know and what they want to learn — promoting a culture of mutual growth, team-building, and hands-on learning.
